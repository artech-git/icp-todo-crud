# `rust_crud_app`

A basic crud application built using `ic_cdk` and `rust`, following assumption were made

- Max memory consumption
- Pagination through vector
- Fixed size of ID and TodoText
- Persistent storage for TodoType

Further actionable considerations: 
- Can we cap out on maximum memory threshold
- should we periodically drian the Pagination cache if canister is low on memory 
- If time goes beyond a period should we drop task 

---

Based upon previous considered following routes are devised for communications

For generating a fresh todo from scratch, pass the text data and returns a 32 character long string
- generate_new_todo():  	String -> UID

For reading a todo through ID, Insert the 32 characters sized uid and retreive todo info
- read_todo(): 			      UID -> String

For Reading a entire todo through ID, Returns entire todo information
- read_complete_todo():   UID -> TodoUnit

For reading multiple todo through pagination, for retreiving a todo list through you have to use following methodology ( pagination_size * ( page_no) ) which will our start and (pagination_size * page_no) which will be our end, this will return us all those todo which are ordered by the time of creation 
- return_todo_paginated(): 	(u32..u32)(pagination_size to page_no) -> Vec<Todo>

For updating a existing todo, you need to pass existing UID and updated todo text, on succesfull update it will return true otherwise will generate a new todo from scratch and return false
- update_todo(): 		        (UID, String) -> bool


For removing/deleting a todo, returns true if removal was succesfull otherwise false 
- delete_todo(): 			      (UID) -> bool

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd rust_crud_app/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
